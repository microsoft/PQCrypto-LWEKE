FrodoKEM: Learning with Errors Key Encapsulation
================================================

This C library implements **FrodoKEM**, an IND-CCA secure key encapsulation (KEM) protocol based on the well-studied Learning with Errors (LWE) problem [1,3], which in turn has close connections to conjectured-hard problems on generic,
"algebraically unstructured" lattices.  This package also includes Python reference implementations. **FrodoKEM** is conjectured to be secure against quantum computer attacks.

**FrodoKEM** consists of two main variants:

* A *standard* variant (simply called **FrodoKEM**) that does not impose any restriction on the reuse of key pairs (i.e., it is suitable for applications in which a large number of ciphertexts may be encrypted to a single public key), and
* An *ephemeral* variant (called **eFrodoKEM**) that is suitable for applications in which not many ciphertexts are encrypted to a single public-key.

In contrast to **eFrodoKEM**, standard **FrodoKEM** uses an enlarged seed for generating the seed for sampling the secret and error matrices, and includes an additional salt in one of the hashing computations in encapsulation and decapsulation.
These countermeasures safeguard standard **FrodoKEM** against some multi-ciphertext attacks. Refer to [3] for more details on these two variants.

Concretely, this library includes the following KEM schemes using AES128 for the generation of the public matrix "A":

* FrodoKEM-640-AES and eFrodoKEM-640-AES:   matching the post-quantum security of AES128.
* FrodoKEM-976-AES and eFrodoKEM-976-AES:   matching the post-quantum security of AES192.
* FrodoKEM-1344-AES and eFrodoKEM-1344-AES: matching the post-quantum security of AES256.

And the following KEM schemes using SHAKE128 for the generation of the public matrix "A":

* FrodoKEM-640-SHAKE and eFrodoKEM-640-SHAKE:   matching the post-quantum security of AES128.
* FrodoKEM-976-SHAKE and eFrodoKEM-976-SHAKE:   matching the post-quantum security of AES192.
* FrodoKEM-1344-SHAKE and eFrodoKEM-1344-SHAKE: matching the post-quantum security of AES256.

The label "eFrodoKEM" corresponds to the ephemeral variants.

The library was developed by the [FrodoKEM team](https://frodokem.org/#team) and [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) for experimentation purposes.
